# ProblemsMarathon

# 1. Use a single array to implement three separate stacks.
# 2. Design and implement a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element.
# Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
# 3. Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
# 4. Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack,
# but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array).
# The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
